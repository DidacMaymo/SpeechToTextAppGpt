I had hoped Henry might want to watch the football or on the big TV, but no. Here's your tea.
Oh, thanks. So what did he do? Stay in his room? Yep. He barely came out of there. Even at mealtimes he just grabs his plate and disappears. Maybe you should insist he stays and eats with you and Jack. How can I, Mum? After what I said to him on Friday. Helen, how many times... I know, I can't keep beating myself up, but you didn't hear the way I tore into him. I just wanted him to understand. The only person Rob cares about is himself. And he knows that now. He never wants to see him again. Oh, come on, love, it'll be okay. Whatever game that pathetic man thought he was playing, it's backfired. But it hasn't. This is all part of his plan. I'm not so sure. Honestly, Mum, he wants me to know that if he can get to Henry, he can get to Jack too. It doesn't matter what the courts say. He was happy to throw Henry under the bus to prove it. Fine, fine. I still think you should talk to Dominic. The non-molestation order's there for a reason. Rob can't think he can ambush you wherever he likes. Imagine if Jack had been at the pool as well. It's okay, I'll call him after the weekend. Good. You'll know what to do. What about Clary? What about her? Do you still want me to cover for you in the dairy tomorrow? Oh, please. Just say I'm sick or something. If I see her, I'm going to say something. I mean, it was hardly the grandie's fault. I know, I know. I'm sure they thought Henry was off enjoying the county show. They didn't know Rob was lying in wait. Which is why I haven't said anything. They still should have kept a better eye on him. Anything could have happened. To be honest, I suspect Henry would have found a way to sneak off somehow. From what he said, he had it very well planned. Henry's spoken to you? When? This morning. After he'd helped Dad with milking. And he opened up to you about what happened? What did he say? Caleb! Stella! What are you up to? Actually, I'm waiting for Rosie to come and choose what ice cream she wants. Tony distracted her with feeding the goats. Ah, I bet she's loving that. Yeah. You alright? Yeah. Busy. That's why I've nipped up to the farm shop. No food at home. And then I bumped into George, who said he was working in the tea room today. And I thought, I'll treat myself. Yeah, I was going to say. I've been past yours a couple of times. And it didn't look like you were in. No, no. Well, we're still hard at it bringing in the last of the wheat. I definitely deserve cake. Of course, yeah. Just as long as you're not... What, Pip? Upset about last week? Well, look, I am sorry. I didn't mean to get touchy. I was just out of sorts. I was trying to help you. I know. I wasn't trying to get you to skate round the rink with me, hand in hand. No, I didn't think you were. I've just been a bit confused, and I suppose after, you know... Look, it was a stupid drunken moment. It didn't mean anything. Didn't it? Not to me. Did it to you? No, no. Well then. We're not teenagers. Doesn't say much for our friendship if it can be ruined by one silly kiss. And I don't want it to ruin our friendship either. It's really important to me. It's really important to me too. So isn't that what matters? It doesn't say much if you can't accept a genuine apology either. I tell you what. How do you fancy a drink in the tea room? What now? Are you in a rush? Well, no. Great. Why don't you think about what you'd like, and I'll check. Tony doesn't mind watching Rosie. It's my treat. Let me get this straight. So when Henry first contacted Rob, it was to tell him to leave us alone? Exactly. He was trying to protect you. So why did he agree to meet him at the county show? Because by then, that man had got his hooks into him. How though? That's what I don't understand. I mean, I know I've shielded him. Tried to help him forget what happened. But surely Henry knows not to trust him. What did Rob say to him? He said you lied to him. Well, maybe not lied, but there's another side to the story. He said you weren't well. What? Now? No. No, no, no. Back when you were pregnant with Jack. He said having a baby does strange things to women. That you were a little unhinged. You get the idea. Did he say he was scared about what I'd do if I left him? That he was worried I might hurt myself? Or Jack? Or Henry? Is that what he told Henry, Mum? Same as he told the jury? And the jury didn't believe him, did they, Helen? Most of them didn't. And neither does Henry. He knows why you flew off the handle at him. And yes, he's going to be upset for a while. But if he's angry with anyone, he's angry with himself for being taken in. Maybe, but still. There must have been some small part of him that wanted to believe Rob. Why else did he make such a big effort to see him? Well... What? That's something else he told me. He didn't arrange it entirely by himself. He didn't? So who did? Mum? It was George. He helped him find Rob online. It's his phone Henry used to get his details. And the county show? Was that George's idea too? Well, sort of. He agreed to take him along. I knew it. Knew what? I knew that Henry wouldn't have done this without someone encouraging him. Right. Where are you going, Helen? I promised Henry I wouldn't say anything. So where's Fallon gone? Whitstable, with him, um... At least you've got George helping you hold the fork. For today, at least. Then he's back on the farm. Oh, well. Anyway, enjoy. Thanks, Emma. Thank you. And thank you, too. Ah, that's OK. No, really, this is a treat. I'm anyone's for a cream tea. That was a joke, Pip. Right, sorry. Look, if we can't laugh about what happened, can we at least try and forget about it? Yeah, sure, absolutely. Like you say, it didn't mean anything anyway. No, exactly. Great. Well, I'm pleased. Please enjoy these me apologising for being weird scones. Apology accepted. So, what's going on with closing the B&B? I was really surprised when your mum told me. Yeah, I know. But now Ben's heading back to uni, he doesn't want to run it anymore. And no one else has the time either. I did say I'd do it. Did you? And then immediately regretted it. But only a couple more bookings and then that's that. Oh, I'm not surprised, I've seen your place. Housekeeping really isn't your thing. Excuse me, I'll have you know, I vacuumed downstairs yesterday. And what about upstairs? Oh, give me a chance, just one step at a time. Yeah, quite, literally. Exactly, exactly. So, what brought that on? I thought I'd make the house presentable for Toby. He's arriving this evening. No, he's not staying at yours, is he? No, no, he's staying on Rex's boat as usual, but he's going to be around all week. I don't want him thinking I'm raising his daughter in total squalor. Fair is the thought. Then next Saturday he's off to Cornwall with Rosie. Oh. I don't know what I'm going to do with myself. Get some sleep, probably. Yeah, yeah, probably. Mum mentioned you might be going away again soon, with Zara, was it? Yeah, that'd be nice. She's the one you met at your sister's wedding. Well, I've not done anything about it yet. Maybe a week away, later in the year. Quite fancy Sisley. Oh, stop, you're making me jealous. Hang on, no way. No, I didn't mean... I've only just noticed you put the cream on first. Cream? On your scone. Where do you think you're from? Devon? Does it matter? I mean, it tastes the same. I'm outraged. Don't worry. Mmm. Delicious. Well, if I'd have known you were that way inclined. Where's George? Get him out here. I want to talk to him, now. I know he's working here. But, Helen, hold on. Why do you want to talk to him? Hasn't he told you? Told me what? He's been helping Henry get in touch with Rob. Last Thursday, at the county show, he was there. Sorry, what? Rob was at the show? You're Rob? Yes. George took Henry to meet him when you were meant to be supervising. I don't understand. Right, there he is. George! You looking for me? What's she talking about? How could you? After everything we've done for you? Excuse me? Giving you the benefit of the doubt. Letting you work on the farm. Oh, right. Because everyone's desperate to pick runner beans for you. George. I didn't do anything. Henry made me help him. So it's true, then? You expect me to believe that? George, you are 18. Henry's 12. Believe what you like. All right, all right. Can we take this somewhere else? I trusted you. I let him go to the skate park with you. You're disturbing my customers. To the show. You're supposed to be an adult. Have you any idea what I've had to do to stop that monster getting near us? We all know what you did. I beg your pardon. Helen. No, no, no, no. You're not going to let him get away with that. Henry would never have done something so idiotic without you goading him. Well, at least I didn't lie to him. Excuse me. How come you didn't tell Henry his dad wanted to see him? Doesn't he deserve to know? That man is not his dad. Oh, yeah, sorry. I forgot. Henry doesn't know who his dad is. No one does. George. You got yourself knocked up with a turkey baster, didn't you? Couldn't get a real man, could you? You crazy bear. You nasty. That is enough. Both of you. What are you going to do? Hit me? Don't tempt me. And there it is. Helen, I think you should leave. So much for the helpless female act. What are you doing? Filming. For my own protection. Stop it. Put it down. Whoa, get off. I'm serious. Helen, you need to... For the record, she just tried to grab my phone. Leave. I don't want him filming me. Then stop trying to come near me. If you don't like it, just leave. Yeah, who's threatening who? Just shut your mouth. You think you're being threatened? You think I'm threatening? Me? I'm the scary one? I'm crazy? Bingo. Do you have any idea what it's really like to not feel safe? Tell us. Yeah, of course you don't. You need to calm down. You are just a sad, pathetic little boy. Hey, don't talk to him like that. Yeah, why not? That's what he is. Yeah, and I hope you feel proud of what you've created. Right, you know where the door is. Just go before you embarrass yourself anymore. Yeah, that's fine. I'm going. Oh, don't end the show now. I don't want him anywhere near my son. Do you hear me? You stay away from Helen. Just get out. Wow, that was off the scale nuts. You go and wait for me out the back. I'll be through in a second. Now. Please. Fine. I'm so sorry everyone. That's not something that normally happens here. Please, if you could just bear with me for a little while. Blimey. What's all that about? Rob Titchener. But he hasn't been around for years. So what exactly happened? Where do you want me to begin? Helen? Oh my Lord, what is it? It's fine. I'll be alright. What's happened? I found George. I was so angry, I just stormed in there. Oh no. What happened? I lost him, Mum. I can't even remember what I said. Look, I'm sure it wasn't as bad as you think. No, it was. It was in front of the whole tea room. They'll all be talking, they'll know. Know what? About Rob. It's all anyone will be thinking about when they see me now. Why can't I ever escape?
